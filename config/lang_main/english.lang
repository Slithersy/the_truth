Lock all the pieces together as you go. Let a partner help you with the back piece and the torso.[br]4: Tap the "Secure"-button on your arm piece. You should hear the suit seal itself.[br]5: The suit will then start to equalise pressure and tap into the oxygen tank.[br]6: If the suit doesn't seal itself, flex the shock absorbers and try again. If it still won't work, do not try to fix it yourself! Contact maintenance.[br]Note: The HPSes are very heavy and the suit will compensate. You will effectively be stronger than you think you are. Be careful![br]Regular training applies: Don't hold your breath, don't stay out too long, don't dive too deep, don't dive with malfunctioning equipment.</Entry>

Your latest tests show your brain is slowly recovering, but it's still too early to tell how well it will adjust to the damage. The bleeding will continue over the coming months at least and you will need to come to the hospital a few times to drain the cavity to prevent the blood from building up pressure.[br]Since excessive stress could be fatal, I have written you a prescription for Prazosin to help you with your nightmares. Please read the instructions and medicate accordingly.[br]Try to get a lot of rest and I will see you next week.[br][br]Sincerely,[br]Dr. Erin Peake</Entry>

The mother and her children, traveling in a robust SUV, were left bruised but largely unharmed. The other party was less lucky. As the car crashed into the passenger side Ashley Hall, 23, sustained devastating damage and suffocated from blood trapped in her lungs before the ambulance arrived. Her friend and driver, Simon Jarrett, 26, survived but with complicated results believed to leave him with permanent brain damage.[br][br]The driver of the SUV, whose name has not been released by police, claims it was an accident and practically unavoidable.</Entry>

	<Entry Name="UniMagFront">Put your scalpel away - The brain can heal itself![br]"The brain has an amazing transformative quality - a plasticity - that allows it to compensate and even heal itself," explains Paul Berg, a graduate student in neuroscience at York university in Toronto. It is this quality that Berg and his colleague David Munshi, a student of computer science, are hoping to encourage. "It's about getting the brain to do the right thing. And we hope to accomplish this with simple things like: exercise, therapy, and light medication."[br]But Munshi and Berg are not looking for a miraculous panacea, it's about finding the optimal treatment for each patient. They start out recording something called a Nakajima-neurograph. "It's like a picture that indicates direction," says Munshi, "Instead of a static brain scan the neurograph can tell us where your brain is going."</Entry>
	<Entry Name="UniMagBack">It is not a long forecast, it's about milliseconds, but with the right computer model Berg and Munshi can then administer all kinds of treatments without risking actual harm to the real brain. "We could try giving your brain an overdose of painkillers while running a marathon," suggests Berg, "It's just a computer model. We are able to fail treating you a million times over only to find the right way." And when they do find that optimal treatment that's when they apply it to the real patient. It's still in the early stages, but their project has caught the attention from PACE Laboratories who has promised to assist them with both equipment and work space. "We are very fortunate to get all this support," says Berg, "Now we just need to get out of the limelight and actually do the work."</Entry>

	<Entry Name="EMAIL_2_BODY">Hi Paul,[br]Talked to PACE about using the lab this week. I have managed to book the scanner for tomorrow morning and again on Friday. It's not a lot but they said we could use the empty reception area as a kind of office. It would allow us to use their computers to run models and also if a time slot opens up, we can get in there and use the scanner rig right away.[br][br]I thought we could run some tests tomorrow. We could do a scan of each other to learn the equipment. It's supposed to be pretty easy.	On Friday I'm hoping Dr Erin Peake will send somebody over. She has a patient that was recently in a car crash. Should be interesting.[br][br]- David</Entry>

	<Entry Name="EMAIL_3_BODY">I found some extra time in the lab today. Unfortunately nobody told us about the code change. So I called Security, talked to Professor Wei to have him vouch for our project and finally got a hold of some honcho over at PACE's legal department that could re-grant us permission to use the lab.[br][br]I'm not allowed to repeat the code in mails or texts, but I'll leave a note or something in case we forget.[br][br]- Paul</Entry>

	<Entry Name="PamphletOmniTool">OMNITOOL v2.5[br][br]The Omnitool is an advanced interface for accessing, managing, and controlling computerized systems. The on-board intelligence includes an open set of behaviors and protocols to enable the user to automate routine actions through basic logical charts. Over time the Omnitool will automatically adapt its programs to cover subconscious behavior to optimize work and minimize user error. The Omnitool has a short-range signal useful for basic or automated actions such as opening doors, while performing complex operations the Omnitool should be physically connected to a workstation or terminal.[br][br]To upgrade your device simply slide operators into the Main or the Auxiliary slot. The Main slot has a standard C(11-21) connector which allows the user to fit most market Cortex Chips into the Omnitool. Note that introducing an additional A.I. will override the on-board intelligence. The Auxiliary slot is a multi-connector fitting a large range of Tool Chip models including, but not limited to: A1(113-398B), A2(090-101X), HaiTT(1-9), JuCi(3-29).</Entry>

	<Entry Name="PilotTerminalFile_2">The pilot system has become increasingly unreliable. Everyone who's been using it the last couple of months has been having headaches and spells of nausea. Last week Gavin was knocked out for 30 hours when trying to direct a helper cluster. This is not acceptable. We will figure this out, but for the time being I'm shutting down the usage of the pilot system. This means you will have to do some more heavy lifting, performing the operations through programming or physical labor.

We should be able to get 20 - 25 years of production before we have to fall back on the turbos.[br][br]The robots are getting increasingly erratic all over Pathos-II and unfortunately there's no universal kill switch.

	<Entry Name="CargoTerminalCometMemo">Pathos-II MEMO - "IMPACT EVENT"[br][br]On this morning of January 12 (05:13) the comet Telos crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The impact ranks as one the largest collisions ever recorded on earth. All evidence indicates that the surface has gone completely barren and is no longer able to sustain life. Pathos-II's unique location has provided unparalleled safety for our staff. Some structural damage has been noted, but no casualties reported. The largest loss was the weather and communication station located on surface platform Omega (unmanned), which is under the circumstances a small price to pay.[br]Theta will hold an emergency meeting to discuss the future of Pathos-II and ultimately mankind. More on the matter will follow.[br][br]Overseer K. Fourqurean</Entry>

	<Entry Name="BrandonEntry_1">Akers finally agreed to evacuate Delta. Goya, Krier and I moved into Theta today. Akers said he'd stick around for a while longer. That crazy bastard. I take pride in my work, but goddamn that place is miserable since the surface stopped sending parts.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BrandonEntry_2">Did my ARK scan together with Alice. Strohmeier told me that the hangover would basically kill me. Such an asshole. I was fine at first, but got a splitting headache a couple of hours later. The biggest pain was that Chun girl, she is so fucking uncomfortable at all times it makes my skin crawl.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BrandonEntry_3">Strohmeier went ballistic and shut down all future scans for the ARK project. Apparently Konrad wanted in on the continuity and just fried himself right in the Pilot Seat after the scan. Something tells me we'll be getting new security ciphers.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BrandonEntry_4">Just heard that the Komorebi survey team is going to Delta and pick up Akers. He's been alone for months now. Can't imagine what he's been up to.</Entry>

	<Entry Name="CatherineEntry_1">Imogen Reed tested a machine today. It was clearly corrupted by WAU, but more importantly it was assembled in a seemingly primitive way. Like someone had specifically created it for WAU to steal. When activated the machine mimicked the room and Reed along with it. At some point she was scanned and then loaded as a simulation inside the digital space. The presentation shocked Reed and was quickly terminated.[br]It scares me how much it reminds me of my AR capsule.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="CatherineEntry_2">After dissecting the "Vivarium" machine that Reed activated, it's clear that WAU copied my capsule project to construct the scene to hold the Reed simulation. It's actually very similar in its construction except for one point. Where my capsule houses flat people constructed from model neurographs, the Vivarium's brain scan lives on. It isn't limited by its content, from the originating brain scan Reed emerged. The Reed inside the Vivarium was a perfect copy.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="CatherineEntry_3">I have it. I can save humanity. I can build an artificial reality capsule that can hold every living member of Pathos-II. I can't figure out how it worked with the Vivarium, but I can replicate WAU's scanning technique using the Pilot Seats. They are already prepared with the type of electromagnetic drums needed.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="CatherineEntry_4">It was even easier than I thought. The Pilot Seats are already set to allow the diffraction and high energy needed to capture the scan. I suspect WAU has been using the seat to steal scans from us for a while. I guess that explains the Mockingbirds. The WAU must have stolen scans from people using the Pilot Seat and used it as a basis for intelligence in the machines.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="CatherineEntry_5">With a surprisingly positive reaction from the team we have now officially started the ARK project. We are to scan all the people we can find and load them into the capsule. Then we will launch it into space using the space gun. It's nice to think something will live on like that.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="CatherineEntry_6">Mark Sarang killed himself after his scan. He has been suggesting everyone should kill themselves as it would somehow allow them to actually get on the ARK. I'm not sure how that would work. It did trigger a lot of arguments among the staff and apparently it's my fault somehow. Strohmeier is not happy with me. Hope it will calm down.</Entry>

In case of an emergency you may direct Julia Dahl at Omicron to forcefully eliminate any opposition, but please make an effort to avoid extreme actions.[br]The WAU is an important, costly affair and we hope to follow a steady development without setbacks.[br][br]The supervisory board</Entry>

	<Entry Name="MainTerminal_Answers">ANSWERS</Entry>
	<Entry Name="MainTerminal_Question_0">Recently it was decided that the ARK-project would become Pathos-II's last official commitment. The staff has been urged to carry on with their duties despite earth's catastrophic condition.[br][br]I think the ARK-project is the most logical step towards saving mankind and that we should spend as much time and resources as needed to complete it.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="MainTerminal_Question_1">To embark, every passenger needs to be flushed with electromagnetism using a Pilot Seat. These scanning sessions are known to cause nausea and headaches sometimes lasting up to 3 days.[br][br]I think temporary physical discomfort, no matter how severe, is a small price to save mankind.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="MainTerminal_Question_2">The ARK is built to fit a Ranger Mk VII probe, meaning it could be shot into space with the Omega Space Gun, and technically survive for thousands of years, living off the light from our sun and distant stars.[br][br]I think the ARK should leave earth behind and be launched into space.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="MainTerminal_Question_3">The digitalization of humanity is an opportunity to make a quantum leap in our own evolution. The people inside the ARK will out of necessity be generated from existing genetic code, but could be altered to allow for cosmetic changes, ease aging, and even prevent death.[br][br]I think we are at risk of losing our humanity if we were to rid ourselves of disease and our mortality.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="MainTerminal_Question_4">There are only 58 people left alive to be stored inside the ARK. A way to diversify and expand the population would be to introduce artificial intelligences that would in every way appear to be human, but with childlike and naive sensibilities. As we continue to explore the nature of intelligence we may find a way to make them smarter in the future.[br][br]I think even an inferior group of artificial people would benefit our society.</Entry>

It had a remarkable bone growth that seemed to interfere with its perception. Brought it inside to study it, but it stiffened and died in the process. During postmortem study the thing kicked back to life while being out of water. Kept swinging for a few minutes so I returned it to an aquarium. It instantly started banging into the glass and bludgeoned itself to death before I could relocate it.</Entry>

It's a 150cm long Rudderfish that looks like it has merged with some other kind of fish or shark. It's the freakiest form of mutation we've seen so far. It's clear that it is getting worse.

	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFile_1">Lisa Cameron[br]2103-03-23[br][br]The structure gel has been charged and actually keeps going for a while, even when removed from a power source. If applied to circuits it seems to help out with connectivity.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFileName_2">Function</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFile_2">Lisa Cameron[br]2103-03-25[br][br]It seems like it's not only connectivity but even functionality. The gel can make simple machinery work and act more efficiently. However, the modifications that the WAU has made to the gel are full of extra information that doesn't necessarily make sense - when applied to something more complicated it causes the gel to act as a cancer upon the host eventually ruining it. We could use the gel to our advantage, but it needs to be uncalibrated to get rid of the bad code.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFileName_3">Pathology</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFile_3">Jacob Halperin[br]2103-05-07[br][br]Applied gel to dead mouse. The gel caused the mouse to appear alive. It was put into the same habitat as a living mouse. The re-animated mouse was apathetic while the living one seemed stressed. After 15 minutes the re-animated mouse attacked and killed the living mouse. Half an hour later the re-animated mouse stopped moving. The corpse was solid as the gel had hardened within it.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFileName_4">Progress</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFile_4">Jacob Halperin[br]2103-07-09[br][br]Re-animated another mouse with structure gel. This time it was done with uncalibrated gel as produced by Eames. The results were impressive. The thing appears catatonic, but it's more of a sleepwalker. To avoid the thing hardening as before electromagnets are used to cause a low electrical current within the animal. This has also provided us the ability to somewhat control it.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFileName_5">Chemical Analysis</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFile_5">Paula Lansky[br]2103-12-12[br][br]The Structure Gel remains unchanged on a fundamental level. It's still the same crosslinked gel with aligned graphene in a polyunsaturated matrix that was installed throughout Pathos-II a few years ago. The problem is not the gel, but its controller, the WAU. The gel has not taken on any new properties. The WAU simply uses it in ways that we would never even have dreamed of.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFileName_6">Study Results</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BioMechTerminalFile_6">Claudia Eames[br]2103-12-19[br][br]Overwhelming evidence concludes that all deformed creatures, the fish, the sharks, and even the helpers, were manipulated by the WAU via structure gel. They have in some manner been exposed to charged gel and in turn stricken by a cancerous growths that affect their whole being. It's difficult to ask why when talking about an AI, but it all started shortly after the comet killed the surface. I can't for sure say if it's bad code or a carefully programmed mercy killing, but it looks like it's not going to make things easier for us to survive.</Entry>

	<Entry Name="DiveSuitTerminalFileName_1">HPS - Information</Entry>
	<Entry Name="DiveSuitTerminalFile_1">A high pressure power suit guaranteed to withstand temperatures spanning from 50°C to -75°C, while keeping a steady 40°C (default) on the inside. The suit will automatically shield the wearer from pressure and maintain the normal 1 ATM up to a depth of 5000m. The on-board controller monitors the wearer's physical state and is able to minimise risk of shock, hyperventilation, and even dehydration.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="DiveSuitTerminalFileName_2">HPS - Usage</Entry>
	<Entry Name="DiveSuitTerminalFile_2">The suit is easily assembled through rotating neck and wrist rings that locks the gloves and the helmet in place. Note that the joints won't seal unless the Controller is able to identify a wearer through a set of sensory systems. Suits may be locked to specific personnel, but as a default the suit will accept anyone.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="DiveSuitTerminalFileName_3">HPS - Controller</Entry>

	<Entry Name="BiolabReaderArticle_1">Paula Lansky[br]2104-01-03[br][br]Confirmed a correlation between the overloaded systems and the corpse of Dr Ross. I was able to shield off the corpse inside the glass jar for a couple of seconds and witnessed a massive drop in the readings. If we really have to keep Ross inside Omicron I suggest finding a way to erect a permanent barrier to avoid severe system malfunctions.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="BiolabReaderArticle_2">Lisa Cameron[br]2104-01-15[br][br]WAU is definitely repairing Ross' corpse. It's the most insane thing I have ever encountered. Somehow the WAU, primarily relegated to the structure gel inside the walls, is bombarding the corpse with every system it can access. The glass jar is surrounded by an unhealthy amount of electromagnetism and radiation which seems to be instructing gel already stuck inside Ross' body. Nots sure what the WAU expects to happen when it's restored, but at least all the crazy should stop when the body hits 100%.</Entry>

	<Entry Name="DahlLaptopFilename_1">TAU Evacuation</Entry>
	<Entry Name="DahlLaptopFile_1">On September 13th Vic Auclair ordered the staff at Tau to evacuate and move up to the plateau. Together with engineer Alan Waldeck I descended into the abyss to assist the evacuation. Following protocol we waited at the Climber platform for 140 minutes and made several attempts to contact Tau. I decided to move towards the site, thinking I might intercept them. That's when I noticed the guiding lights flickering and soon the whole path shut down - Omega Sector swallowed by darkness. I pushed on with my floodlight until I heard screaming over the short-range radio. It carried on, breaking in and out of range. As I hurried closer to investigate I came upon the lacerated body of Field Worker Espinosa - something big had almost cut her in two. I considered the importance of saving Tau and more specifically Ross, as I heard Espinosa's colleagues getting massacred over the radio. Seeing no way to possibly improve the situation, I hurried back to the Climber and left the people at Tau to their fate.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="DahlLaptopFilename_2">TAU (Carth. Notes)</Entry>
	<Entry Name="DahlLaptopFile_2">With some luck Ross made it back to Tau and is able to continue his work at Alpha. To avoid further disturbances I have decided to report the evacuation as a complete failure, hoping it will stop Theta from attempting another one. Claudia Eames, the manager of Omicron, has already ordered the Climber to stay at the plateau for now. My report on the savage wildlife scared everyone enough to even stop Waldeck and Darby from maintaining the LUMAR probes. It's a good thing Golaski is off-site, because I have a feeling he would not have approved.[br]The restrictions came out slightly more severe than I had anticipated, but I'll take it. As long as Ross is left alone to work with the WAU.</Entry>

	<Entry Name="ToBeFlesherPadFile_1">I was hoping to see Omicron today. The evacuation ordered by the people at Theta was a gift, an excuse to leave Alpha and abandon the WAU. As the storm cleared we were swarmed by monsters that the WAU had "facilitated". We were ambushed and forced back towards Tau. Glasser, Kovsky, Coetzee and I survived. Auclair is in the infirmary, but it doesn't look good.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="ToBeFlesherPadFile_2">Coetzee made a run for it, to check Observation for anything resembling food. Going outside is beyond dangerous. It's like going to buy cigarettes in a hurricane. She came back and she had some crumbs with her. We all knew it was empty. I think she just wanted a chance to die without carrying the responsibility of taking it herself.</Entry>
	<Entry Name="ToBeFlesherPadFile_3">People from the Plateau showed up. It was a group of engineers from Theta telling us that they wanted to use the Omega Space Gun to launch something called the ARK. It's an artificial world that carries brainscans made from people working at Pathos-II. The idea is silly, but endearing. We all agreed to do a scan, so we could take part in this "afterlife".</Entry>
	<Entry Name="ToBeFlesherPadFile_4">Some of the engineers returned from Phi. Apparently they postponed the ARK launch. They were all in a very foul mood and difficult to get any straight answers from. Except for one very important thing: They all wished to remain at Tau to figure this ARK business out, but they had scheduled for the Climber to pick them up tomorrow. Someone would need to catch that Climber to alert Omicron to what was happening. Luckily Glasser and I were able to take on this mission. I will finally get to to warn Dahl and Sarang about the critical situation at site Alpha.</Entry>
