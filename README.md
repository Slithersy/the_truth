# The Truth

[SPOILERS] - There is an intro in the beginning that has huge spoilers, please finish the game before playing this mod.

It was all a lie, all of it. Catherine, Akers, and most importantly - Robot Girl. You are playing as Simon Jarrett who has started to lose Tracer Fluid in the blood. Is reality breaking apart or is it just your imagination? Discover the truth.
